# Arduino-Line-Follower

Arduino based line follower robot

This is my first arduino based line follower. I'm using this to learn how the motor works, the IR works and overall system works. I've made several tests to allow step by step understanding on how this works. By breaking down into small pieces, I hope this can be understood by someone who is really new to Arduino.

Parts list:
1. Arduino UNO R3
2. L298N motor driver
3. 5 in 1 infra red sensors 
4. 2 ea DC motors
5. Battery pack and switch
6. Robotic base kits to attach the motors and the parts

Steps:
1. Assemble the parts
   Assemble the robotics base kit & motors. Connect the battery pack to L298N motor driver. Refer to below illustration.
